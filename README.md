# Door Knocker Mod (Forge)
An forge port of the Door Knocker mod by MeowMC, originally built for fabric.

Curseforge page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/door-knocker-forge

Original project: https://github.com/MeowMC/Door-Knocker

Fabric project Discord: https://discord.gg/m3EjDuuekg

Basically this mod adds one thing:

The ability to knock on doors and trapdoors.

This can change the world for role playing users and can also just be a nice thing to have when playing with friends!

### Known Issues
Any help with these issues via PR would be extremely welcome. <3

- Can be spammed (needs a cooldown)
- Occurs at the end of breaking a door (Either the cooldown or a change in the event type would fix this issue)
- Occurs when breaking a door (maybe only activate if the button has been held down for less than a certain period of time)
