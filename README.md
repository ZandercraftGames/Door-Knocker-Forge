[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/ZandercraftGames/Door-Knocker-Forge/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ZandercraftGames/Door-Knocker-Forge/actions/workflows/gradle.yml) [![CodeQL](https://github.com/ZandercraftGames/Door-Knocker-Forge/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ZandercraftGames/Door-Knocker-Forge/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

<a style="colour: red;">This mod is for Forge. The official Fabric version is available [here](https://github.com/MeowMC/Door-Knocker). Please note that the Forge version is a port so it may differ from the Fabric version.</a>

Basically this mod adds one thing:

The ability to knock on doors and trapdoors.

This can change the world for role playing users and can also just be a nice thing to have when playing with friends!

### Known Issues
Any help with these issues via PR would be extremely welcome. <3

- Can be spammed (needs a cooldown)
- Occurs at the end of breaking a door (Either the cooldown or a change in the event type would fix this issue)
- Occurs when breaking a door (maybe only activate if the button has been held down for less than a certain period of time)
